Next to the native 120Hz and native 90Hz modes, they have an additional mode that allows the software to be rendered at 60 fps. They use a motion interpolation technique to boost the in-game frame rate of 60 fps to 120 fps in order to reduce frame latency and the resulting motion sickness.\n\nCombine this with black frame insertion and you have a consistently clear image with next to no motion artefacts. This is made possible with the instant response ability that is unique to self emissive display technology.

That shows that it isn't too much faster than a Note 9 for example. I was really excited when I found out that the new iPhones were announced but I guess there really isn't anything noteworthy in the \"new\" lineup. That $750 \"cheaper version\" of the iPhone X is garbage for its price, they try to justify the loss of dpi and such by comparing it to the ridiculous price of the X instead of comparing the XR to other android flagships that are in the same price range. And also you can change the background focus of any image taken on any phone after taking the picture, it might not look as good except if you know what you're doing and took a proper format picture beforehand. There really isn't anything about these phones that make them stand out. I guess we'll have to wait for the X2.Ôªø", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Manu Kolehmainen", "likes": "1"}

You keep bringing up how its a lease and stuff of course it is. And you can ‚Äútake it back‚Äù its called surrendering if you fall in hard times just send it back not that hard. I know what I sign up for obviously im not going to ‚Äúquit‚Äù my carrier with a leased phone like you keep saying. Same as if it was a car not gonna quit the bank and go somewhere else lol you cant. The upgrade plan is not for everyone. If you want to shell out full price every single year for a flagship phone you can if thats what you like its up to you. Personally i would rather get a new phone for half the cost every year and give back my old one. Its not hard theres no strings attached theres no damn apr% theres not one piece of paper i had to sign. If your smart like me you sell the old phone for over the remaining ‚Äúlease balance‚Äù and make a profit so essentially im not paying any more real money towards the new phone every year and i make an extra 100 or so dollars from the sale. Seriously it doesn‚Äôt take a scientist to figure basic math. It benefits me and so many others, the upgrade plan if it didn‚Äôt then iPhone wouldn‚Äôt have created there own program to do so as well. \n\nA chart of a breakdown of an iPhone over 2 years:\n\nOption 1: Buy phone upfront cost.\n\nYear 1 - 1,000 + tax\nYear 2 - 1,000 + tax (because oh I wanted the new phone) \n\nTotal - Over 2,000 \n\nOption 2:\n\nYear 1 - pay taxes only to get phone initially = around 80$ something dollars\n\nThen pay $41.76 a month for 12 months then upgrade IF you like total around 580 something for one year.\n\nYear 2 - taxes down on another phone and same monthly prices and upgrade option. \n\nToal 1,160 approximately.\n\nNow good sir how is that more than option 1 ? Oh and i didn‚Äôt mention the option to sell the phone and make a profit so it could be a lot cheaper. Im not even going to go into you buying a phone right out and attaching apple care which would be around 1300 dollars every year. Or do the iPhone Upgrade option that includes and unlock phone with apple care for 49 a month you do the math.Ôªø", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Frank Spalding", "likes": "1"}

OMG GROUND BREAKING TECHNOLOGY THAT US HUMAN BEINGS WILL PAY $1000+ FOR. Btw my first phone is an apple I'm not hating or anything it's just that two years ago I saw no change in apple the biggest change yet is of course the X but other than that its always been better camera, better battery I guess, and bigger screens. If you look at it this way there are so many better phone currently with not just better spec but something new for example the note 9. Again I'm not being bias or anything, but if you can see it that way then hope you understand. Right now there are so many Android phones that introduce us to something new not just an upgraded version but something that is different. If apple could do that then I will definitely buy their products again. Right now I see no change for the past 9 years and just last year I saw the X and was surprised but Android caught up and did it way better.Ôªø", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "DŒπvŒπŒ∑ŒµTM", "likes": "1"}

I personally feel iPhone puts tech that's been introduced several years ago in previous devices and charge a arm and a leg. Then use amazing, and incredible adjectives while they present them.

Dynamic range and true tone algorithm alone should make this a superior display compared to the Note 9.\n\nZmantech !\nFace recognition on Samsung devices is a joke in terms of security, speed and reliability.

Therefore they keep the same design with its minimal clear logo on the back so people recognize the brand easily. This cannot be said easily with phones like the LG G series, Samsung S series, Oneplus, etc all looking the same at the screen side with slight variations on the cameras. 2. The average person doesn't like change. If iPhone goes bold, they may lose customers (and potential money). We all know how money hungry they are. They keep it all the same so people have security that they won't have to learn a bunch of new features. They keep everything the same so it's easily recognizable to anyone.

They did add features, like 3D touch, animoji,  touch id, an excellent taptic vibrator, FaceID, dual cameras, but it's nothing to rave about, except faceid, but that's gated behind the X. Animoji is useless. It's a cool party trick, I guess. 3D touch was rumored to be removed on these new phones so RIP. Taptic engine can easily be removed without much loss. It's better that way: it'll give more battery life and some people enjoyed the nice home clicky button and maybe they might re-add the headphone jack! Because touch id and dual cameras became the standard, iPhone is pretty poor in uniqueness except the notch? Does that count? What does Samsung/Google provide? A better lowlight camera. A better display. More customization. iPhone fans WANT these things but iPhone keeps denying it and adding nothing! When you watch s9 and pixel 2 ads, it's always showing how cool the camera is and how beautiful the OLED is. iPhone just flows past the phone in an aesthetic background. Cool. New features? Where?

It's like thinking of the pen while writing all the time (which the user should only think about the content they want to deliver instead).\n\nFor the price, my opinion is, real innovation comes from iPhone, and I don't mean new ideas, I mean good hardware and software experience that user can adopt, those comes from their R&D. Just imagine a world without iPhone, who else can they copy from? And because their iOS is so good, we don't even need to buy the flagship, just get an iPhone 7 (USD449 - 32gb) or even an iPhone 5s (USD290 - 64gb) model.

Also, the os is THE best in the market. Sure ios is great too, but im not talking about which is better. Also about android being free, why does that matter. If anything, thats better. Android is the most complex and advanced os in the market, ios is run by apple and they arent as complex as android runs. That can be a good thing and a bad thing, but the good outweighs the bad. \n\nAlso, apple slows down phones. Even if they said its because of the battery, why have they kept it a secret?

All I do is pay the taxes on the new phone upfront and send AT&T back the old one within a time frame. I have never had issues. You can also choose to pay off the remaining installments and keep the phone. Or sell it (like me) for more than the remaining installments and make a profit. Because they send you the new phone while you still have the old one. Not really expensive at all. $499.56 is awesome for a brand new iPhone every single year.

Especially games for example. They become higher quality have more features etc and consequently take require more space. And its not just apps. Even photos and videos are getting higher quality e.g 4k which consumers more gegabite. So as a  result the same phone storage sizes we once thought were big are now getting relatively smaller and smaller. Not literally. But indirectly compared to the rowing size of apps. So as a result we need bigger memory sizes to make up for this increase in app sizes etc. of course not everyone's use will necessarily need such levels of gb but even then its nice to know you will never have to transfer or delete files ever again basically. You can just take as many photos as you want and download as many apps as you want without ever worrying about storage. And its especially important for power heavy uses who use big giant business or other apps on their phone.  So these 128 gb and 512 gb  models have their market definetly.Ôªø", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Eventus Vantos", "likes": "1"}
