Company owners can still choose to discriminate against drug users if they choose to.

Get them off the backs of US tax payers, and give them the opportunity to become a productive citizen and start contributing to our society again, instead of leaching off of it. Keep welfare, but use the money you saved to help retrain these people for new careers that report they will hire them if you train them. It&#39;s better for the American, and Mexican economies if we do this. Would also create the biggest housing boom &amp; migration in US history, which equivocates into decade to come of ultra high-levels of new jobs and true economic prosperity for both countries.

Of all the candidates in my lifetime, Hillary was by far the worst. She belongs to a witches church in California, and visits there often to participate in evil events. She worships the devil, according to the man that was the Clinton&#39;s right hand man for many years back in Arkansas. She&#39;s a habitual liar and a danger to everything we know and love, but the voters couldn&#39;t see that and they became violent when she lost,........showing an unhealthy, un-American adoration of an individual that should be in prison.¬†¬†¬† Men like Ben Carson and Ron Paul aren&#39;t taken seriously, or in the case of Ron Paul in 2008, we allowed the media to criticize, humiliate, demonize and lie about him on a daily basis. We&#39;re too ignorant as a nation to spot evil bullshit ganging up on a righteous, intelligent candidate. Ben Carson is the same type of decent gentleman, only lacking in the experience that Ron Paul had.

Deep and frightening emotion¬†lusting for¬†a shallow and evil person; that&#39;s who we&#39;ve become.¬†¬†¬†¬†Thank God we barely came up with enough voters¬†that knew who she was.

Approximately 80,000 people are killed as a direct result of the blast, and another 35,000 are injured. At least another 60,000 would be dead by the end of the year from the effects of the fallout.<br /><br />U.S. President Harry S. Truman, discouraged by the Japanese response to the Potsdam Conference‚Äôs demand for unconditional surrender, made the decision to use the atom bomb to end the war in order to prevent what he predicted would be a much greater loss of life were the United States to invade the Japanese mainland. And so on August 5, while a ‚Äúconventional‚Äù bombing of Japan was underway, ‚ÄúLittle Boy,‚Äù (the nickname for one of two atom bombs available for use against Japan), was loaded onto Lt. Col. Paul W. Tibbets‚Äô plane on Tinian Island in the Marianas.

Five and a half hours later, ‚ÄúLittle Boy‚Äù was dropped, exploding 1,900 feet over a hospital and unleashing the equivalent of 12,500 tons of TNT.
